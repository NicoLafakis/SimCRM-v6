# SimCRM - HubSpot Simulation

Lightweight React + Vite app that simulates HubSpot CRM activity by creating contacts, companies, associations, notes, deals and progressing them through marketing and sales stages.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Run tests:

```powershell
npm test
```

Notes

- This is a local simulation only and does not call HubSpot APIs. It is structured so real API calls could be swapped into the SimulationEngine.
